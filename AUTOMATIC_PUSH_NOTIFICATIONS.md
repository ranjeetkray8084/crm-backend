# 🔔 Automatic Push Notification System

## Overview
The CRM system now automatically sends push notifications whenever regular in-app notifications are created. This ensures that users receive notifications on their mobile devices in real-time, matching exactly what they see in the app.

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. **Automatic Trigger**
- **Every time** `notificationService.sendNotification()` is called
- **Automatically** sends push notification to ALL devices of that user
- **No additional code** needed in controllers

### 2. **Dual Delivery System**
```
User Action → In-App Notification + Push Notification
     ↓              ↓                    ↓
  Lead Created → Saved to DB → Sent to Mobile App
     ↓              ↓                    ↓
  Admin Notified → In-App + Push → Real-time Alert
```

## 📱 What Gets Sent

### **In-App Notification:**
- Saved to database
- Visible in notification list
- Marked as read/unread

### **Push Notification:**
- **Title**: Exact same message as in-app notification
- **Body**: Exact same message as in-app notification  
- **Data**: Includes notificationId, userId, companyId, message
- **Devices**: Sent to ALL active devices of the user

## 🎯 Where It's Applied

### **Controllers Already Working:**
✅ **LeadController** - Lead creation, assignment, status updates
✅ **FollowUpController** - Follow-up creation and reminders
✅ **NoteController** - Note sharing and visibility
✅ **PropertyController** - Property creation and updates
✅ **NotificationController** - Manual notifications

### **Notification Types:**
- 📅 **Follow-up Reminders** (Daily at 9 AM)
- 🆕 **Lead Assignments** 
- 📝 **Note Sharing**
- 🏠 **Property Updates**
- 👥 **Admin Notifications**
- 🎯 **Director Notifications**

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Core Method:**
```java
public void sendNotification(Long userId, Company company, String message) {
    // 1. Create in-app notification
    Notification notification = new Notification();
    // ... save to database
    
    // 2. AUTOMATIC: Send push notification to ALL devices
    var pushTokens = pushTokenService.getActivePushTokensByUser(user);
    for (var pushToken : pushTokens) {
        pushNotificationService.sendPushNotification(
            pushToken.getPushToken(),
            message,  // Same as title
            message,  // Same as body
            Map.of(
                "type", "notification",
                "notificationId", notification.getId(),
                "userId", userId,
                "companyId", company.getId(),
                "message", message
            )
        );
    }
}
```

### **Key Features:**
- ✅ **Multi-device support** - Sends to all user devices
- ✅ **Error handling** - Push failures don't break notifications
- ✅ **Consistent data** - Same message in both systems
- ✅ **Real-time delivery** - Immediate push notification
- ✅ **Automatic** - No manual intervention needed

## 🧪 Testing

### **Test Endpoint:**
```
POST /api/notifications/test-with-push

```

### **What to Check:**
1. **In-app notification** appears in notification list
2. **Push notification** received on mobile device
3. **Same message** in both places
4. **Real-time delivery** (immediate)
